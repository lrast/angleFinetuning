# Studying fine tuning and multitask learning in an angular reproduction task

## working steps:
1. careful stimulus generation
2. positive controls
3. initial experiments



## experiment ideas:
1. adapation to different distribution of angles
2. hysteresis in adaptation to wide vs narrow distributions
3. continual learning on different distributions


## results:
